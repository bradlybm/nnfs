neural networks from scratch

followinng this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3&index=2 tutorial
i'm posting my work following the tutorial on here and any other practice challenge

I am keeping a record of what I'm learning and writing notes within the programs for future reference.
I am also doing this as a way to get used to git, github and python. 

p1.py -> 1st video, using raw python to simulate a neuron

p2.py -> 2nd video, formating an output layer that takes input form 4 neurons 

p3.py -> 3rd video, using numpy (dot product) to simplify the code
